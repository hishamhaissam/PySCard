pyscard is a python module adding smart cards support to python.

It consists of the smartcard.scard module, an extension module wrapping
Windows smart card base components (also known as PCSC) on Windows, and
PCSC lite on GNU/Linux and macOS, and of the smartcard module, a
python framework with objects wrapping PCSC API.


Documentation
-------------
All documentation is provided in the `smartcard/doc` directory of the
source distribution.  Examples are provided in the `smartcard/Examples`
directory of the source distribution.  The binary distribution does not
include any documentation, tests scripts or examples.


Installation
------------
The pyscard library is packaged using the standard distutils python
module.

Installation on windows
-----------------------

Installing on windows from the binary distribution
--------------------------------------------------

1. download the binary msi installer or self-executable installer from https://sourceforge.net/projects/pyscard/files/pyscard/
2. execute the installer

The binary msi installer and self-executable installer are packaged for
a specific version of python, and have name similar to
`pyscard-1.9.<xx>.win32-py2.7.msi` and `pyscard-1.9.<xx>.win32-py2.7.exe`.


Installing on windows from the source distribution
---------------------------------------------------

1. you will need swig from (http://www.swig.org), and a C compiler.

Visual Studio 2008 is required for building the C language wrapper. You can
download Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
(http://aka.ms/vcpython27).

You can install swig using:

* Install the chocolately package manager
* Open a powershell as administrator mode, run
```
choco install swig
```
* Then in the same window, install pyscard by
```
pip install pyscard
```

2. download the source distribution

The source distribution is available `pyscard-1.9.<xx>.tar.gz` for Windows and GNU/Linux.

3. unzip the source distribution, open a console and type the following:

```
setup.py build_ext install
```

This will build pyscard and install it in the site-packages directory of
your python distribution, e.g. `c:\python25\Lib\site-packages\smartcard`.

This install procedure does not install the documentation, examples or test
files.

Installation on GNU/Linux or macOS
----------------------------------

Installing on GNU/Linux or macOS from the source distribution
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. you will need gcc, swig (http://www.swig.org), and pcsc-lite
(https://pcsclite.apdu.fr/)

2. download the source distribution

The source distribution is available as `pyscard-1.9.<xx>.tar.gz`.

3. untar the source distribution

4. from a terminal with root privileges, type the following:

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

This will build pyscard and install it in the site-packages directory of
your python distribution, e.g.
`/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/smartcard`.

Developer documentation, unit tests and examples
------------------------------------------------
The developer documentation is in the smartcard/doc directory of the
source distribution.

Examples are located in the smartcard/Examples directory, and the pyunit
unit tests in the smartcard/test directory.

Build instructions for packagers
--------------------------------

Building a binary distribution for Windows
------------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will
need a C compiler and swig (same requirements as for installing
from the source distribution).

In the root directory of the source distribution, execute the following
command in a console:

```
setup.py build_ext bdist_msi
setup.py build_ext bdist_wininst
```

This will build the msi installer and self-executable installer in the
dist directory, with names similar to `pyscard-1.9.<xx>.win32-py2.7.msi` and
`pyscard-1.9.<xx>.win32-py2.7.exe`.

Building a binary distribution for GNU/Linux
--------------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will
need gcc, swig and pcsc-lite (same requirements as for installing
from the source distribution).

In the root directory of the source distribution, execute the following
command in a terminal:

```
/usr/bin/python setup.py build_ext bdist
```

This will build a package similar to `pyscard-1.9.<xx>.linux-i686.tar.gz`
containing a tree

Building a binary distribution for macOS
----------------------------------------

To build a binary distribution from the source distribution, you will
need swig and Xcode (same requirements as for installing from the source
distribution) and bdist_mpkg 0.5.0+ (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bdist_mpkg/).

Install bdist_mpkg by executing the bdist_mpkg setup.py script with
build and install as arguments, i.e. from the root directory of the
bdist_mpkg source distribution enter: python setup.py build install.

From the root directory of the pyscard source distribution,
i.e. in the src directory, execute the following commands in a terminal:

```
python setup.py build_ext
bdist_mpkg setup.py
```

This will build package `pyscard-1.9.<xx>-py-2.7-macosx10.7.mpkg` in the dist
directory.
